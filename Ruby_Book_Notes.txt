notes from the book:

Chapter 1: The Basics

the / divides two numbers, but wont give decimals unless you put 
  a decimal in the equation ex: if you are dividing two numbers 
  (15 / 4)(it will give you 3)
if you want to get the whole answer without a remainder, 
  use a float. ex: (15.0 / 4)(will give you 3.75)
  
the % (modulo) gives the remainder. Ex: (15 % 4)(will give you 3)
a better example is:
9357 / 1000 will give you 9, but
9357 % 1000 wil give you 357
  
integers (whole numbers) are represented by i, so i = integer 
if converting a string to an integer, use .to_i, ex. '45'.to_i 

floats (numbers with decimals) are represented by f, so f = floats
if converting a string to a float, use .to_f, ex. '45.55'.to_f

  
.to_s converts integers and floats to strings
s usually statds for string
ex:
puts is short for put string 

a hash is a set of key-value pairs, represented by {}.
A hash consists of a key, usually represented by a symbol, 
  that points to a value (denoted using a =>) of any type of data. 
ex: {:dog => 'barks'}
aka: {(=hash):(=symbol)dog(=key) =>(=denotation)'barks'(=value)}
there can be multiples: ex: {:dog => 'barks', :cat => 'meows', :pig => 'oinks'}
ex: {:dog => 'barks', :cat => 'meows', :pig => 'oinks'}[:dog] 
  would return "barks"
  
An expression is anything that can be evaluated. 
a ruby expression always returns a value, even if it an error or nil


Chapter 2: Variables

When you assign a variable, you use the = symbol. The name of the variable goes 
on the left and the value you want to store in the variable goes on the right.

there are five types of variables. Constants, global variables, 
      class variables, instance variables, and local variables. 


Remember. The individual = symbol assigns value while 
  the == symbol checks if two things are equal.
  
gets stands for "get string"  Alone, gets will return with \n (carriage return) at the end
chomp will get rid of the \n. together they are gets.chomp

Blocks:
A block is a piece of code that follows a method's invocation, 
delimited by either curly braces {} (used if its one line of code)
or do/end (used if it is multiple lines of code):
EX:
1.upto(4) { |number| puts "Echo#{number}"}
      or
1.upto(4) do |number|
  puts "Echo #{number}" 
end
this explained is:
1.upto(method)(4)(the 4 here is the method parameter) do (starts the block) |number|(block parameter or local variable)
  puts "Echo #{number}"
end(finishes the block)

-With blocks, the one rule that we want to emphasize is that: Inner scope can 
access variables initialized in an outer scope, but not vice versa.


Chapter 3: Methods 

use def (short for define) when defining a method. This way you can use it over and over 
throughout the program. Always finish it with an end.
ex:
def say
  # method body goes here
end
-method invocation refers to calling a method.
-parameters are in () directly following what is difined. 
ex: 
def say(words)
  puts words
end

say("hello")
say("hi")

- Parameters are used when you have data outside of a method 
definition's scope, but you need access to it within the method 
definition. If the method definition does not need access to any 
outside data, you do not need to define any parameters.

-Arguments are pieces of information that are sent to a method 
invocation to be modified or used to return a specific result. 
We "pass" arguments to a method when we call it.
