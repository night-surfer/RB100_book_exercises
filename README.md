# Helpful reminder- important steps for git workflow

 #### Adding a Repository

#Make a folder in Cloud9: mkdir folder_name

#Initialize (or create) a new repository with command: git init

#Create a README.md, LICENSE.md, & .gitignore 

          #### Making changes to files or programs

#Open and make changes to project files in the text editor

#check status with the command: git status

#stage changes for commits by command: git add file_name 
          or with a (.) to add all the files that were changed

#commit changes to version history with command: 
          git commit -m "Insert a brief message about the change made here"

#review previous changes with git log (press q when ready to exit git log)

#You can see the specific changes made to a file before committing it by using: git diff


          #### Removing a repository

#If you need to remove a repository that has hidden and/or regular files in it, 
          use command: rm -rf repository-name


          #### Branches

#if you want to add a branch, use command: git branch name_of_new_branch 

#to switch between branches, use command git checkout name_of_branch_you_want_to_switch_to 

#make changes to file/program, then add and commit them

#if you want to delete a branch, use command: git branch -d name_of_branch 
          (hint: you cant be in that branch when trying to delete it)
          
          #### Merging

#make sure you are on the right branch (aka: the branch you want to merge into, usually the main branch)

#apply command: git merge name_of_branch_you_want_to_be_merging

#check ls and the file/program for the changes you made. Also check git log

          

          #### Push to github 

#Go to github.com and make new repository there

#clone or copy: git remote add url_given_to copy

#enter: git branch -M main

#enter: git push -u origin main

#enter: username and PAT token when promted

#then check: git log to see changes. Then check github.com for updates


          #### Pulling from github.com to local repository 

#use the edit button in on github, then make a note before commiting changes, 
          commit directly to the main branch, and click on commit changes.

#from cloud 9, command: git fetch, then command: git diff main origin/main
          (aka: git diff original code, or unchanged branch       followed by the new code, or changed branch)

#then command: git pull --ff-only (#hint-make sure you are in the right branch-usually main)

#then check git log and git status to see the changes
